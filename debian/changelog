  Checkpoint release

  [ root ]
  * initial support for node name and help for operational command
    structure. behavior is similar to configuration request. op mode
    data can be retrieved with mode="op" attribute.
  * fixed permission on touch gui file. added op configuration support
    for dynamic and static enumeration values and for multinode node
    types.
  * added support for op mode commands. now return unmodified (except
    for '\n' conversion) output from op mode shell.
  * changed op mode node name from multi to node.tag for multinodes.

  * fix backend op mode detection
  * fix backend op response format
  * fix backend op response special character escaping
  * add basic op commands support in gui front-end

  [ root ]
  * added <action> tag to op mode node that contains a "run" action in
    the template. Note that this definition can be expanded to config
    mode, but currently only sets this node for an op mode configuration
    request.
  * strip out comments in allowed template keyword--these are values
    that are enclosed by "<" and ">". will need to have these statements
    migrated to help in the operational mode template files.

    value returned from popen call rather than response string.

    op command.wq

  [ An-Cheng Huang ]
  * remove compiler warning

  [ slioch ]
  * added more single quotes to protect against rogue hidden cmds. also
    modified mass replace to allow for replacement=victim value.
  * limit incoming request size to 8192 bytes. On requests exceeding
    8192 bytes the request is dropped and the binary exits with no
    response

  [ An-Cheng Huang ]
  * 64-bit fix for gui backend
  * fix debian lighttpd cgi config file
  * merge Kevin's Vyatta GUI work from phuket

    correctly
